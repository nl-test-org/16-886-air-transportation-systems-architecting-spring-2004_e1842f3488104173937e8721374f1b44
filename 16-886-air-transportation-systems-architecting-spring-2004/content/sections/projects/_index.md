This semester's project dealt with economizing cargo operations using the improved aerodynamic efficiency afforded by formation flight. The final report, "Architecture and Evaluation of a Formation Flight System for Existing Cargo Aircraft," was submitted for publication and is cited below. The detailed studies upon which the report was based are linked below as "Reference Material for a Proposed Formation Flight System." The resources in this section are organized by class of deliverable.
